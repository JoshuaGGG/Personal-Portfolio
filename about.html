    <h2>Joshua Guzman</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone my name is Joshua Guzman. I am a junior currently attending Edison high school and CART who will be graduating for the class of 2024. Some or my hobbies are playing basketball, video games and gardening as well as learning to code. </p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <img src="images/Basketball.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Basketball was introduced to me at a very young age and it is a sport that I cherish everyday in the court. The tough jumpers and adrenaline that there is when playing the game as a team allows it to be fun and challenging. I play regularly at school and in my free time when I just want to relax and clear my mind overall in a soothing environment. </p>
  <img src="images/video games.jpg" alt="">
  <p>My video game passion has been an exciting journey. Ever since I started on the 2ds I got hooked on the intricate visuals and the video game  genre in general. As I grew more interested in gaming I advanced through the years with a new console as well as what it brought with its fascinating features. This is part of my entertainment where I want to be fully immersed into and will always be a source of joy and excitement. </p>
  <img src="images/gardening.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Gardening and cultivating different kinds of trees has been a special connection to me and the beauty of nature. Its the moments that capture the time when not long ago the peach tree was still young and did not give its fruits. It is all about time and of course providing the right amount of water and sunlight. I love the process of nurturing and taking care of the several cultivations that were once a tiny seed. The joy of eating a ripe peach or any harvest off when its ready is a must have. </p>
  <img src="images/code.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Vex IQ robots were the starting point for me in middle school when I started to learn about code. By my freshmen year during the pandemic I took web programming, and by my junior year I am progressing and learning more about code by the day with web applications. Learning about programming has been a wealth of knowledge that provided me with true skills about the digital age. I think it is important to learn all about technology and how it will shape the future.  </p>

  <p>Over the course of my freshman year, I had the opportunity to participate in several externships in the summer which provided a deep dive in many interesting fields like cybersecurity, game design, startup and learning about tech fundamentals. During these externship series I was able to work with professionals in the industry and collaborate on real world projects. For my dedication in this time I was awarded with certifications for completing these externships. It was a valuable learning experience that I am grateful to be a part of and learn all about these careers. </p>
