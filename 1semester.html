      <p>Delvehomes was a story that we read in the beginning of the semester. It talked about a dystopian society who lived underground and took all commands by the machine. The purpose of this website was to replicate the idea of how these underground houses could look like and advertised in a promotional website. This was a project that was done in a team of two and that were divided into a collaborative effort. The first step was to make the design of the website and this was done in figma. A place where anything can be sparked upon an idea. The next step was to choose the font as well as the colors and we decided to go for roboto and some clean complementary colors. Making the text was the other way around the main source of targeting the original elements of the story that was finished. Finally the use of html and css in Visual Studio Code finished the inspiration to the overall website that we wanted. Some of the roadblocks that were issued in this project were the images and the form. It was difficult to find image that were exactly to the book The Machine Stops by E.M. Forster. Ultimately pexels the free source of images helped out entirely as there was a clean connection between the theme of the future for homes. For the tour form we were unfamiliar with how we could make a form and we used online resources like w3 schools. This gave a clear direction towards creating the tour form and we hosted the finished website on netlify.</p>

      <h3 id="Cybersecurity">Cybersecurity</h3>
      <p>This was the second project of the first semester and the sole purpose was to be a project manager of a series of the website of your choice from the topic chosen. The topics available were social issues and current events that occur like water conservation all the way to identifying “Yellow Journalism”. I chose cybersecurity because I was interested in this career after I had done a cybersecurity externship for Worked. The requirements for any website created is to be prepared with all the requirements of design inspiration, mood boards, wireframes, fonts and colors. I investigated other websites that were informational with the cybersecurity topic and closely looked and realized that almost every website was using blue. A blue color in cybersecurity is a color that promotes trust and stability much like how the police use a dark blue. My obvious selections of colors were a light gray, dark blue, and baby blue this was a nice contrast to the color scheme of the cybersecurity feel I wanted to have. For the font I chose glegoo font because of the precise balance of shapes and strokes almost any text on the website is visible in this font. The first page of the website was general background information about what was cybersecurity and the rest of the other sections were about all of the cybersecurity threats as well as how to prevent it. Once the preparation for the website was done the programming process started. This was a set of rotations of 20-30 minutes each classmate dedicated a certain portion of making the website. As project lead manager you had to talk about each person in the class and decide how you wanted certain things to be. Communication was an integral part of the programming process and was a key factor to the overall success of the project. The problems faced in this project were the difference of using selectors some people used classes and other people used ID’S but came together with the google doc that I made to track the changes made as well as the comments for what each selector did.</p>
